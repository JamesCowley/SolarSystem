# Java GUI test

### Background
Created in year 2 pf my MSci Theoretical Physics course at UCL (date ~ March 2014). The project's main purpose was to learn how to build a basic GUI in Java.


### Requirements
The project's minimum requirements were:

* The sun

* At least 3 planets

* Planets moving in circular orbits

I expanded on these with:

* Correct elliptical orbits

* All planets + some comets, asteroids and [dwarf planets](http://i.imgur.com/aAt54Nm.jpg)

* Sliders to adjust the relative speed and scale of the model.

### Running it

The main method is in `SolarSystem.java`, so either test run that in [your IDE](https://eclipse.org/), or compile all three source files into a `.jar` and open that.

Alternatively, I've included a pre-compiled version, `Solar.jar`, if you want to download and run a program you can't verify isn't malware. It's not malware, but it *is* an option.
